I'll take it back now\n\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\nYou might also like\nI take it back with the rhythm and blues\nWith my rap pack, I'll be singing the news\nTryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school\nI'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop\nBringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes\nI'll give you the truth through the vocal booth\nAnd stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit\nThey try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot\nBut then again that's what they're supposed to do\nAnd I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm\nWhispering, \"Everything that happens is from now on\"\nI'll be ready to start again by the end of the song\nAnd still they're claiming that I handle it wrong\nBut then I've never had an enemy except the NME\nBut I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be\nWith only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees\nAre healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree\nSinging for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids\nI keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic\nI'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it\nThis song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now\n\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo, I'll take it back now\nNow, I don't ever wanna be perfect\n'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless\nAnd I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed\nTaking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus\nPutting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton\nConsidering a name change, thinking it was hopeless\nRhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition\n'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written\nNow absence can make your heart ache\nBut drinking Absinthe can change your mind state\nVividly, need to let my liver be\nAnd I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends\nIt's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\n'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally\nIt might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but\nBut I just write schemes\nI'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely\nYou'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates\nHaving a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made\nAnd every single second knowing that we'll never betray\nThe way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down\nThat's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\n\nMy dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme\nTill I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?\nWith this you must know that the numbers just sold\nWill keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\nWe forget 90 percent of it when we wake\nBut the other 10 percent, it never fades\nDreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads\nTried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade\nOh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more\nA couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought\nYou'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors\nNow I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour\nWriting love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit\nYou can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\nI'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss\nAnd most of these other guys are kids that pose\nHis little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is\nDreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it\nTread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower\nYou'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow\nIgh!58"

I wanna know\"\nNo prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness\nYou open the front door, he boots you in\nThere's something new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror\nGet your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error\nHe towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight\nAt this point, your life flashes before your eyes\nYour handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor\nDespite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye\nAnd in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece\nAnd dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street\nLittle lady left this earth in the worst way\nAll because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday\nAnd we're all under the upper hand\nAnd going mad for a couple grams\nAnd we don't wanna go outside, tonight\n'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland\nAnd sell love to another man\nIt's too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nFor angels to fly\nAnd fly, fly\nFor angels to fly\nTo fly, to fly\nAnd angels to die17"

to ride\nThe paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\nFriends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride\nAnd when the world's against me is when I really come alive\nAnd every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\nYou know that I've got whisky with white lines, and smoke in my lungs\nI think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun\nI need to get in the right mind and clear myself up\nInstead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become\nI guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me\nWithout a nine-to-five job or a uni degree\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\nThey showed me the locked doors I find another use of key\nAnd you'll see\n\nI'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nI used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs\nI chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\nI think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell\nRelationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well\nAnd ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\nBecause you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun\nPlease know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run\nI beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become\nOur conversations with my father on the A14\nAge twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams\nNow I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me\nWith my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans\nWembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou\nI may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud\nAnd to the next generation, inspiration's allowed\nThe world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now\nSomehow\n\nI'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nYou might also like\nI woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror\nThinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner\nThe industry told me to look like them\nBut I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner\nI wish that she could have been my first time\nAnd I wish that I'd never took that first line\nAnd I wish that every word in this verse rhymed\nBut forgive me if it doesn't\nI wish that I could make peace with my older cousin\nI wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't\nI wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'\nAnd the taste stays underneath my tongue, and\nWish that I had known what to do as a youngen\nWish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party\nWith that hardly matters now, man, does it?\nWish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it\nI wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget\nBut while we're on the subject\nI wish my private life would have never gone public\nBut that's the sacrifice that we make\nSpendin' my whole time high livin' life away\n\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI wish my family and friends, they stay healthy\nI wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy\nI found myself late night wishin' on a star\nEveryday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh\nAnd I wish I'd never run through\nEvery woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to\nI wish I was the role model you looked up to\nIf I told my fans the things I did they'd say, \"Fuck you\"\nI wish I was home more\nI wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour\nAnd I wish I'd grown more, wish I told more\nPeople that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for\nAnd I wish he never got cancer\nAnd if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?\nOh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressing 'cause\nEvery day this cocaine gets the best of us\nUsin' my balance on razor blades\nSpendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait\n\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\n\nI'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat coat\nMum sayin', \"Don't smoke,\" no, I don't listen, I got\nLove for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast\nPeople that I don't know share the same vision\nI find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine\nTryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign\nSometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme\nStarin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine\nShit quick before I hit it again\nSurrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men\nAnd who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen\nJust let me hit the studio when we can rip it again\nI'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick\nMy daddy told me, \"Work hard and you can never be shit\"\nI've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad\nSet back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had\nOne wish9"

God only knows\nFeel the wind's harsh refrain like the clouds gripped my face\nSaying, \"It's alright to run from all this pain\"\nOh, and when it's time to go with one last breath that's in my lungs\nI'll scream, \"It's all for love,\" I'll scream, \"It's all for love\"\n\nCome and kiss me, salt water\nOh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees\nI'm free in salt water\nEmbrace the deep and leave everything\nIt was just a dream\n\nI can see it up ahead where the sky meets the ground\nAnd after that, there's only moving grey\nI am filled up with regret\nWith things I did or never said, just leave that well alone\n\nAnd come kiss me, salt water\nOh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees\nI'm free in salt water\nEmbrace the deep and leave everything\nIt was just a dream\nYou might also like\n(Ah-ah)\nIt was just a dream\nIt was just a dream\n(Ah-ah)\nIt was just a dream\nWas it just a dream?\n\nNow, I'm standing on the edge, gazing into hell\nOr is it somethin' else? I just can't tell\nWhen there's nothin' left, I close my eyes and take one step\nAnd say, \"Well, here it goes,\" I say, \"Well, here it goes\"\n\nCome and kiss me, salt water\nOh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees\nI'm free in salt water\nEmbrace the deep and leave everything\nIt was just a dream"
