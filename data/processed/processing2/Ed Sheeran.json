Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on? She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance  You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band But she fell in love with an English man Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand Said, \"Baby, I just want to dance\" With my pretty little Galway Girl You're my pretty little Galway Girl  You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me  You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band But she fell in love with an English man Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand Said, \"Baby, I just want to dance\" My pretty little Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl  And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night I walked her home then she took me inside To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write About a Galway Girl and a perfect night  She played the fiddle in an Irish band But she fell in love with an English man Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand Said, \"Baby, I just want to dance\" My pretty little Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl7"

That's why you and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied You and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied  Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that I never wanna settle down, come around Break up the love like Lego now Never wanna turn into another \"like you\" Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views Everything’s great, not everything’s sure But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus Now, I'm in a position to be another stalker Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward Like our last kiss, it was perfect We were nervous on the surface And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it Pain is only relevant if it still hurts I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss  So am I close to you anymore if it's over And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

I'll take it back now  Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No  I take it back with the rhythm and blues With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot But then again that's what they're supposed to do And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm Whispering, \"Everything that happens is from now on\" I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong But then I've never had an enemy except the NME But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now  Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No, I'll take it back now Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect 'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written Now absence can make your heart ache But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state Vividly, need to let my liver be And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me And I hope to see him blowing up globally 'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but But I just write schemes I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made And every single second knowing that we'll never betray The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No  My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie? With this you must know that the numbers just sold Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget 90 percent of it when we wake But the other 10 percent, it never fades Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss And most of these other guys are kids that pose His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow Igh!5"

And every weekend in the winter, you'd be wearing my hoodie With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own 'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits Acting as if we were two rabbits and then, you'd vanish Back to the burrow with all the Celtics I disappear, you call me selfish I understand but I can’t help it I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back Overlook the situation 'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications And I'm not saying we should be taking a break Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane But in a day, we'll have to say it again  Oh, Nina You should go, Nina 'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road, Nina But then again, you should know, Nina 'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now, now? Love will come and love will go But you can't make it on your own Sing that song, go Oh, won't you leave me now? People grow and fall apart But you can't mend your broken heart Take it back, go Oh, won't you leave me now?  Oh, Nina You should go, Nina (Love will come and love will go) 'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina (But you can make it on your own) Oh, won't you leave me now? (Sing that song, go, oh, won't you leave me now?) And I've been living on the road, Nina (People grow and fall apart) But then again, you should know, Nina (But you can mend your broken heart) 'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina (Take it back, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)

Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way? And I know you love Shrek, 'cause we've watched it 12 times But maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale, too And if your DVD breaks today, you should've got a VCR 'Cause I've never owned a Blu-ray, true say And now I've always been shit at computer games And your brother always beats me And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you'd laugh at me, and be asking me If I'm gonna be home next week And then you'd lie with me 'til I fall asleep And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets  And you will never know Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love When you wake me up  And I think you hate the smell of smoke You always try and get me to stop But you drink as much as me And I get drunk a lot So I’ll take you to the beach And walk along the sand And I'll make you a heart pendant With a pebble held in my hand And I'll carve it like a necklace So the heart falls where your chest is Now, a piece of me is a piece of the beach And it falls just where it needs to be And rests peacefully So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now Against yours now  'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Oh, maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up3"

It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me Eventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be Either way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this These things happen for a reason and you can't change **** Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty But I had to get this off my chest I don't love you, baby I don't need you, baby I don't want you, no Anymore I don't love you, baby I don't need you, baby I don't wanna love you, no Anymore5"

Little moments that pass us by Oh, but I remember  The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn I still feel the first fight, and we both made it out alive And I can't wait to make a million more first times Mmm, mmm  The greatest thing that I have achieved Was four little words, down on one knee You said, \"Darling, are you jokin'?\", and I just said, \"Please\"  Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man? Little moments that pass us by Oh, but I remember  The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry The first look in your eyes when I said \"I love you\" I can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night I can't wait to make a million more first times Mmm, mmm  Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?

I wanna know\" No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness You open the front door, he boots you in There's something new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error He towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight At this point, your life flashes before your eyes Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor Despite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street Little lady left this earth in the worst way All because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday And we're all under the upper hand And going mad for a couple grams And we don't wanna go outside, tonight 'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland And sell love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly For angels to fly And fly, fly For angels to fly To fly, to fly And angels to die1"

Things don't look up when you're goin' down I know your arms, they are reachin' out From somewhere beyond the clouds  You make me feel Like my troubled heart is a million miles away You make me feel Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space Celestial Celestial, oh  We were made to be nothin' more than this Findin' magic in all the smallest things The way we notice, that's what really matters Let's make tonight go on and on and on (You make me feel) We were made to be nothin' more than this Findin' magic in all the smallest things (You make me feel) The way we notice, that's what really matters Let's make tonight go on and on and on  You make me feel Like my troubled heart is a million miles away You make me feel Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space Celestial, ohh Celestial, ohh Celestial, ohh We were made to be nothin' more than this Findin' magic in all the smallest things (Celestial, ohh) The way we notice, that's what really matters is Make tonight go on and on and on Celestial"

Everything's such a blur It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt On a late night, coming home from way too many train rides Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time Highbury estate's fine, smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines, hey  I haven't slept for the past week Two hours ain't enough for me I feel inspired, at quarter to three am I haven't changed since our last meet I'm still getting all my meals for free I think I'm being shunned by my feet again  It's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be It's not a homeless life for me, yeah  And now I'm sitting on a night bus, flicking through my iPod Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong Truth be, never went to UNI People see right through me, but I'm not a fool, see I'm never gonna do one, I'm gonna live past 22, done Everything I need to except get a 2:1  I haven't slept for the past week Two hours ain't enough for me I feel inspired, at quarter to three am I haven't changed since our last meet I'm still getting all my meals for free I think I'm being shunned by my feet again  It's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah When I feel cold You keep me warm And I'm not looking for some loose change Just wanna find a true mate who wants to be my duvet, yeah  It's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be It's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be It's not a homeless life for me, yeah1"

        "lyrics": "Smoke alarm went off at nine I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye She left a note \"I'll be back in 5\" Well, I'm still waitin' for that moment to arrive, hey  I was told to put my job in front of you But it won't hold me like you do  But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up When I see my friends, all they say is hold up Ed, remember the time When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups? Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what? You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that So maybe you should learn to love her Like, like the way Maybe you should learn to love her Like, like the way Maybe you should learn to love her Like, like the way And maybe you should learn to love her Like, like the way you wanna be loved  I never told her that I liked The way she dances slightly out of time And pretends she knows the words to a song she's never heard But I tell her all the time, hey  I was told to put my job in front of you But it won't hold me like you do  But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up When I see my friends, all they say is hold up Ed, remember the time When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups? Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what? You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that So maybe you should learn to love her Like, like the way Maybe you should learn to love her Like, like the way Maybe you should learn to love her Like, like the way And maybe you should learn to love her Like, like the way you wanna be loved But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up When I see my friends, all they say is hold up Ed, remember the time When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
