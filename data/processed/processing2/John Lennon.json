You have big eyes.) Me, I took it for real I wrote six hundred songs about how I feel I felt like dying, and crying, and committing suicide But I felt creative and said: \"What the hell's this got to do with What that silly little man's talking about?\" You might also likeBut he did charm me in a way Because he was funny, sort of cuddly Like a sort of, you know (Like a teddy bear) Little daddy with a beard Telling stories of heaven As if he knew You could never pin him down But he often spread rumors through his right hand man Who used to be with the CIA And told about the planes he saved How Maharishi came through the storm on a plane And the pilot was getting worried they couldn't land When Maharishi looked up And with one foul look (According to the man who works for him) Everything was OK and they landed After that I thought: lies But who was that woman that looks like Jean Simmons That keeps going to him for private interviews? She must have been about forty, forty-five Kept telling about her husband cause he wasn't there He was always trying to get a private audience with the Maharishi And he kept refusing I knew only one thing: He must have had some of his own It must have been that little Indian piece She came with the tailor And could sit at his feet And that was one in five hundred The rest had to wait like good American people In lines to see the master walking on the petals Who lived in a million dollar staccato house overlooking the Himalayas He looked holy (But he was a sex maniac) I couldn't say that, but he certainly wasn't... (Holy) In the true sense of the word, that is1"
