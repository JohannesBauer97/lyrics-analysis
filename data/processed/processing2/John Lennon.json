You have big eyes.)\nMe, I took it for real\nI wrote six hundred songs about how I feel\nI felt like dying, and crying, and committing suicide\nBut I felt creative and said:\n\"What the hell's this got to do with\nWhat that silly little man's talking about?\"\nYou might also likeBut he did charm me in a way\nBecause he was funny, sort of cuddly\nLike a sort of, you know\n(Like a teddy bear)\nLittle daddy with a beard\nTelling stories of heaven\nAs if he knew\nYou could never pin him down\nBut he often spread rumors through his right hand man\nWho used to be with the CIA\nAnd told about the planes he saved\nHow Maharishi came through the storm on a plane\nAnd the pilot was getting worried they couldn't land\nWhen Maharishi looked up\nAnd with one foul look\n(According to the man who works for him)\nEverything was OK and they landed\nAfter that I thought: lies\nBut who was that woman that looks like Jean Simmons\nThat keeps going to him for private interviews?\nShe must have been about forty, forty-five\nKept telling about her husband cause he wasn't there\nHe was always trying to get a private audience with the Maharishi\nAnd he kept refusing\nI knew only one thing:\nHe must have had some of his own\nIt must have been that little Indian piece\nShe came with the tailor\nAnd could sit at his feet\nAnd that was one in five hundred\nThe rest had to wait like good American people\nIn lines to see the master walking on the petals\nWho lived in a million dollar staccato house overlooking the Himalayas\nHe looked holy\n(But he was a sex maniac)\nI couldn't say that, but he certainly wasn't...\n(Holy)\nIn the true sense of the word, that is1"
