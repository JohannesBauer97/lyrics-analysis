We saw brilliance when the world was asleep There are things that we can have, but can't keep  If they say Who cares if one more light goes out? In the sky of a million stars It flickers, flickers Who cares when someone's time runs out? If a moment is all we are Or quicker, quicker Who cares if one more light goes out? Well I do  The reminders pull the floor from your feet In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair Just 'cause you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there  If they say Who cares if one more light goes out? In the sky of a million stars It flickers, flickers Who cares when someone's time runs out? If a moment is all we are Or quicker, quicker Who cares if one more light goes out? Well I do  (I do)  Who cares if one more light goes out? In the sky of a million stars It flickers, flickers Who cares when someone's time runs out?

(Go!) (Go!) (Go!) (Go!) (Go!) No! You can tell 'em all now I don't back up, I don't back down I don't fold up and I don't bow I don't roll over, don't know how I don't care where the enemies are Can't be stopped, all I know, go hard Won't forget how I got this far For every time, saying  In these promises broken, deep below Each word gets lost in the echo So, one last lie I can see through This time, I finally let you go, go, go, go Go, go, go4",

They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads Inside your market, your shops, your clothes My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know But enough pride inside not to let that show My brother had a book he would hold with pride A little red cover with a broken spine On the back, he hand-wrote a quote inside \"When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die\" Meanwhile, the leader just talks away Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay The rest of the world watchin', at the end of the day Both scared and angry, like, \"What did he say?\" Amen, amen Amen, amen Amen  With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen) As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen) As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen) As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen) As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen) As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen) As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)4",

The way there was when you were here 'Cause I'm just sitting in the dark In disbelief that this is real In disbelief that this is real  Have I been lost all along? Was there something I could say or something I should not have done? Was I lost all along? Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one? Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?  And I ask myself out loud...  Have I been lost all along? Was there something I could say or something I should not have done?

Bang, bang, little monkey man, playing with the big guns Only get you slain, I ain't playing, I'm just saying You ain't got a sliver of a chance I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants So shake, shake down, money, here's the breakdown You can play the bank, I'mma play the bank takedown And no mistakes now, I'm coming to get you I'm just a Banksy, you're a brainwash Get the picture? It's like that  We swim against the rising waves And crash against the shore The body bends until it breaks The early morning sings no more So rest your head, it's time to sleep And dream of what's in store The body bends until it breaks And sings again no more 'Cause time has torn the flesh away The early morning sings no more",

City governments are eternally napping Trapped in greedy covenants, causing urban collapse And bullets that scar souls with dark holes Get more than your car stole Some hearts be blacker than charcoal (For real) This society's deprivation depends Not on our differences, but the separation within No reparation is made, limited aid on minimum wage Living in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid Tragedy within a parade The darkness overspreads like a permanent plague I'm the forgotten In the memory you'll find me Eyes burning up The darkness holding me tightly Until the sun rises up",

None of it's real You wanna be an MC? You've gotta study the skill  Who can rock a rhyme like this? Bring it to you every time like this? Who can rock a rhyme like this? Step, step up! Step, step up!  So, you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity But mentally, you don't have the hip-hop energy With a tendency to make up stories (Bullshit) Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40 (Top 40) And your record company is completely missin' it All the kids are dissin' it for not bein' legitimate So in a battle, you can't hack it, react with wack shit And get smacked with verbal backflips Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts It's taken decades for MC's to establish this You're new to hip-hop, and welcome if you're serious But not on the mic, leave that to the experienced  Using the waves of sound The true master paralyzes his opponents Leaving him vulnerable to attack  Who can rock a rhyme like this? Bring it to you every time like this? Who can rock a rhyme like this? Step, step up! Step, step up! Who can rock a rhyme like this? Bring it to you every time like this? Who can rock a rhyme like this? Step, step up! Step, step up! Step up! After years of pain-staking research by the world's leading sound scientists We here at the Sound Institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system Actual movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the cellular structure of the human body And the question must be asked…  Who can rock a rhyme like this?

In my fear and flaws I let myself down, again All because I let myself down In my fear and flaws  I run 'til the silence splits me open I run 'til it puts me underground 'Til I have no breath And no roads left but one No roads left but one  In my fear and flaws I let myself down, again All because  I run and the silence splits me open I run and it puts me underground But there's no regret And no roads left to run",

Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me!) Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Down!) Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace  Keep it locked up, inside Keep my distance from your lies  Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break!) Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me!) Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Down!) Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace Breaking a part of my heart to find release Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace Breaking a part of my heart to find release Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace Keep my distance Keep my distance Keep my distance Keep my distance  Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness Cryptic colloquialisms shift your mid rift Dog paddle through a bog of shadows and smog With my thought catalog, analogue rap battle log Keep my distance and fear resistance Hurt by persistence, the twisted web of tangled lies Strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste And I'm forced to face these hate crimes Against the state of being Feeling the weightlessness press me to the ceiling Reeling around rooms, riding a bubble of sound Tuned to the frequency making your chest shake With every boom Involuntary muscle contraction Ignoring your neck's breaking, musical gas fume euphoria The sound pounds to make the dead flush To hand you a head rush with read rhymes and said stuff",
