Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love You shouldn't have to deal with that I'd never make you feel like that 'Cause  I love me I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me I know you been through more than most of us So what are you What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling, you You give, but you cannot take love  Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different Started realizing a couple places I could take it I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation And influence a generation that's lacking in patience I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience Just me and my old man getting back to basics We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us We even talked about you and our couple of moments He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone Looking like you came from the seventies on your own My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is \"Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?\" You don't even know what you want from love anymore I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?  I love me I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me I know you been through more than most of us So what are you What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling, you You give, but you cannot take love Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it 'Cause that night I played her three songs Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz Boy, was she wrong That was just negative energy for me to feed off Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't? Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? I love me I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me I know you been through more than most of us So what are you What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling, you You give, but you cannot take love  Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G Been a East Side ting Scarborough ting from time, G Been have up di ting dem from time, G So I don't know what's wrong with these Little wasteman out here, eh?

Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone I take a glass of Domina to go with me home Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome I need forty-thousand people to see what I'm on Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves I was an angry yute while I was writin’ Views Saw a side of myself that I just never knew I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do Steady doin' double shifts 1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click More blessings because I'm generous Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it Scary whenever I close my eyes at night Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights But you can rest assured that my mind is right Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days Never stick around to see shit change Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin' Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin' Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz' I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense Especially people that want to lecture me And frame it like they just want the best for me Or they check for me, whatever splits it up So there's more for them and there's less for me They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me No one's done it successfully 7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me You overnight celebrity, you one day star Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity I am a reflection of all of your insecurities Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me There's real ones around me I want to make sure they learn from me I want to see my dawg, but his grandmother's his surety He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency My life is centered 'round competition and currency Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary More Life9",

Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV Young rebel, Young Money, nothin' you could tell me Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin' I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin' On a mission, tryna shift the culture Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin' All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure Like ayy, B, I got your CD, you get an E for effort I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace My life's a completed checklist I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now That's real  How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk Off everything my pen wrote, we went from Bundy to Winslow This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em) The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie All these nineties fantasies on my mind The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time I might come through without security to check if you're fine That's just me on my solo like \"Fuck it\", like \"YOLO\" Wanted to tell you, \"Accept yourself\" You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help You know, back on your feet and shit Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though? Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me Now real nigga, wassup? Ayy, yeah, ayy How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? If there's hell below, I'll see you when you get there Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may, we would just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years It don't mean that we can't have a good life So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us 17",

You've got me fe– You, oh You've got me fe– You, oh, ayy  Missin' out on my years There's times when I wish I was where I was Back when I used to wish I was here Missin' out on my days Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade Most times it's just somebody that's underaged That's probably just alone and afraid And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain I always hear people complain about the place that they live That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give 'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome Then she finally got to Rome And all she did was post pictures for people at home 'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known I know another girl that's cryin' out for help But her latest caption is \"Leave me alone\" I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown To post later and make it look like she still on the go Look at the way we live I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world I was hidin' the world from my kid From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call They always ask, \"Why let the story run if it's false?\" You know a wise man once said nothin' at all I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end? I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then You've got me fe– You, ohhhh, ayy Higher, higher You've got me fe– You, ohhhh, ayy Higher, higher6",

The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya? Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it Damn, this shit could go on a tape Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me? Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team 'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas For real, some nobody started feelin' himself A couple somebodies started killin' themself A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation Bad press during the summer over allegations I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10 Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?  Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in I got her drinkin' with your boy I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeah11",

The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no No, no-no-no, no, no No, no, no, no  Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up And I know who gon' take the fall with me They right here on call with me, they all with me You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it? Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray I dropped out right before I graduate Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day “It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait” And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say Lately I just feel so out of character The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison I'm gettin' straight to the point with it Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute  Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below Who you think runnin' this show? You saw it in me at 20 years old The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game Still drop 40 with liquor in my system Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together And my life is on display like Truman They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner My exes made some of my favorite music I dated women from my favorite movies Karma's such a thing of beauty I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you If I was you, I wouldn't like me either Yeah3",

The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question Last night I went to sleep wanting more Tryna decide what direction I should go towards Some nights I wish I could go back in life Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice 28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me Prolly forever if I stay in my zone I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage You need to act your age and not your girl's age It gets worse by the annual My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention I remember when it used to be music that did it But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'? I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin' We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on But here we are, yeah Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments Bitches alter my messages like we had words And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot 'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block Nobody lookin' out for nobody Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it And then they start to \"R.I.P.\" about it And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it Damn, I just had to say my piece about it Oh, you gotta love it— But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca Julia, Ericka, Southern America Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent I'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin' But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you? Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas Bein' number two is just being the first to lose My city dictated music, nobody seein' us Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all \"Best I Ever Had\" seems like a decade ago Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace? Why you rappin' like you come from the streets? I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese Special order for anybody that's comin' for me Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah And on top of that it's getting harder to eat Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh) Yeah And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop) I know your girl well, just not in public Blame the city, I'm a product of it Young nigga from the city You gotta love it  Yeah, gotta love it *Laughs* Yeah29",

The do or die The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties They try to compare us, but Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride All factual, I call the house \"the embassy\" The studio \"the chapel\", I hate to travel I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural I knew her way back when Hollywood was international Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential I broke spirits that I never meant to My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine And sleep at the opposite times Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I I refuse to comply with regulations I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license They tell me \"don't worry, I got your money\" like Osirus (I'm the Osiris of this shit) Dirty 30, workin' on me Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo Calamari rings and tomato I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo Wakin' up at 6 PM like, \"Where does the day go?\" Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables 2010 was when I lost my halo 2017 I lost a J. Lo A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes Closed off but I could never stay closed Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy Protection that God gave me Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here Cover my ears, my security government tier Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits Check the guest list If opps make an appearance at least it's expected Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace I'll be in better company with my own reflection Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace The TV playin' Al Jazeera Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira  I love, I love I love, I love it Baby, I9",

Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience Between rocks and hard places of all places Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous Please welcome the October fall baby Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares Count it, it's all there, and we all square Quick money, I'm in and out My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out But, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linen'd out More blessings for Sandi and him, more life My parents never got it right But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change If we do get to do it twice in another life Scared to go to sleep now 'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight Tell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I can't see it Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious You just stare at me while you roll Swishers Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it Got two of my niggas off with a \"not guilty\" Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it But still, they try and tell you I'm not the realest Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon I never worked to get it But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories That's gotta stop, though You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas Like, \"This what we need to be on,\" but you never went live You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives Can't show us where the cash is, me, I don't judge I'm just going off what the math is, numbers inflated They all look at me, like, \"What have you done for me lately?\" \"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest.\" Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative My numbers out of this world No wonder they got me feeling so alienated You were the man on the moon Now you just go through your phases Life of the angry and famous Rap like I know I'm the greatest then give you tropical flavors Still never been on hiatus You stay xann'd and perk'd up So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy Is you crazy?6",
