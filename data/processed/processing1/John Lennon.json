You have big eyes.)\nMe, I took it for real\nI wrote six hundred songs about how I feel\nI felt like dying, and crying, and committing suicide\nBut I felt creative and said:\n\"What the hell's this got to do with\nWhat that silly little man's talking about?\"\nYou might also likeBut he did charm me in a way\nBecause he was funny, sort of cuddly\nLike a sort of, you know\n(Like a teddy bear)\nLittle daddy with a beard\nTelling stories of heaven\nAs if he knew\nYou could never pin him down\nBut he often spread rumors through his right hand man\nWho used to be with the CIA\nAnd told about the planes he saved\nHow Maharishi came through the storm on a plane\nAnd the pilot was getting worried they couldn't land\nWhen Maharishi looked up\nAnd with one foul look\n(According to the man who works for him)\nEverything was OK and they landed\nAfter that I thought: lies\nBut who was that woman that looks like Jean Simmons\nThat keeps going to him for private interviews?\nShe must have been about forty, forty-five\nKept telling about her husband cause he wasn't there\nHe was always trying to get a private audience with the Maharishi\nAnd he kept refusing\nI knew only one thing:\nHe must have had some of his own\nIt must have been that little Indian piece\nShe came with the tailor\nAnd could sit at his feet\nAnd that was one in five hundred\nThe rest had to wait like good American people\nIn lines to see the master walking on the petals\nWho lived in a million dollar staccato house overlooking the Himalayas\nHe looked holy\n(But he was a sex maniac)\nI couldn't say that, but he certainly wasn't...\n(Holy)\nIn the true sense of the word, that is1"

Sources said that it was because of a breakdown in communication. Oh lord, the boat was towed into Thai waters by a German freighter and the Thai navy are unaware that the refugees have been guaranteed a resettlement and worst the only took the boat out to sea after providing all passengers with provision\nHey, that's deep man\nThe Chinese newspapers have made the first reference to the country's curtain wall posted campaign according to vice premiar deng xiaoping. And said that the country's stable and its leaders are confident and planning modernisation and programs., oh this should get me in the village bar\nDeng gave blessing to the campaig but he commented not all the opinionsof the masses are carefully thought out nor can we demand that they all be correct. Adding this is nothing terrible. It' bad enough, but its not terrible\nFrom a prison, Richard Nixon, on his second trip outside the United States, sent his resignation with a smiling hand shake politician again. Greedy crowds outside his hotel, and trying a little French\nThey sure as hell didn't try it on Pam Nixon, Mr. Nixon is in Paris and inside this suite to be interviewed on French television. They thought of going on to deliver a speech in England, he'll participate in the French collegue program and said he will answer questions in welsh\nThat's pretty big Mr. M. Ahhh, I'm so cynical, I could just keep on doing this forever because, you know, they ain't gonna be lookin' for my golden bunions in a hundred years from now. They're gonna be sellin' my socks like judy garland. And I hope that they get a good price. I mean, with the inflation and the price of rice. Man, I shouldn't worry, I own all my songs and I wrote them myself too\nI got 24 children, 14 wives, 3 mistresses, 59 accountants, 105 lawyers, 2000.000 fans, a posted system that never fails to land me in jail. And look through my mail. Perhaps have a garage sale. And you know, go save the whale, and a..you know, get a boat and go for a sail, and, and, oh, oh, oh, oh, how do you get out of this hell?

We were twelve then, but, In spite of his sideboards, we went on to become teenage pals.\nAunt Mimi, who had looked after him since he was so high, used to tell me how he was cleverer than he pretended, and things like that. He had written a poem for the school magazine about a hermit who said: “as breathing is my life, to stop I dare not dare”.\nThis made me wonder right away —“Is he deep?”. He wore glasses so it was possible, and even without them there was no holding him. “What ’bus?”, he would say to howls of appreciative laughter.\nHe went to Quarry Bank High School for Boys and later attended to the Liverpool Art College. He left school and played with a group called the Beatles, and, here he is with a book. Again I think —“Is he deep?”. “Is he arty, with it or cultured?”.\nThere are bound to be thickheads who will wonder why some of it doesn’t make sense, and others who will search for hidden meanings.\n“What’s a Brummer?”.\n“There’s more to ‘dubb owld boot’ than meets the eye”.\n“None of it has to make sense and if it seems funny then that’s enough”.\nPaul\nP.S.

It was a typical Frank morning and with an agility that defies description he leapt into the barthroom onto the scales. To his great harold he discovered he was twelve inches more tall heavy! He couldn’t believe it and his blood raised to his head causing a mighty red colouring.\n“I carn’t not believe this incredible fact of truth about my vеry body which has not gained fat since mother bеgat me at childburn. Yea, though I wart through the valet of thy shadowy hut I will feed no norman. What grate qualmsy hath taken me thus into such a fatty hardbuckle”.\nAgain Frank looked down at the awful vision which clouded his eyes with fearful weight. “Twelve inches more heavy, Lo!, but am I not more fatty than my brother Geoffery whose father Alec came from Kenneth — through Leslies, who begat Arthur, son of Eric, by the house of Ronald and April —keepers of James of Newcastle who ran Madeline at 2-1 by Silver Flower, (10-2) past Wot-ro-Wot at 4/3d a pound?”.\nHe journeyed downstairs crestfalled and defective —a great wait on his boulders — not even his wife’s battered face could raise a smile on poor Frank’s head —who as you know had no flies on him. His wife, a former beauty queer, regarded him with a strange but burly look.\n“What ails thee, Frank?”, she asked stretching her prune. “You look dejected if not informal”, she addled.\n“Tis nothing but wart I have gained but twelve inches more tall heavy than at the very clock of yesterday at this time —am I not the most miserable of men? Suffer ye not to spake to me or I might thrust you a mortal injury; I must traddle this trial alone”.\n“Lo! Frank —thou hast smote me harshly with such grave talk— am I to blame for this vast burton?”.\nFrank looked sadly at his wife —forgetting for a moment the cause of his misery. Walking slowly but slowly toward her, he took his head in his hands and with a few swift blows had clubbed her mercifully to the ground dead.\n“She shouldn’t see me like this”, he mubbled, “not all fat and on her thirty second birthday”.\nFrank had to get his own breakfast that morning and also on the following mornings. Two, (or was it three?) weeks later Frank awake again to find that there were still no flies on him.\n“No flies on this Frank boy”, he thought; but to his amazement there seemed to be a lot of flies on his wife —who was still lying about the kitchen floor.\n“I carn’t not partake of bread and that with her lying about the place”, he thought allowed, writing as he spoke. “I must deliver her to her home where she will be made welcome”.\nHe gathered her in a small sack (for she was only four foot three) and headed for her rightful home. Frank knocked on the door of his wife’s mothers house. She opened the door.\n“I’ve brought Marian home, Mrs. Sutherskill” (he could never call her Mum). He opened the sack and placed Marian on the doorstep.\n“I’m not having all those flies in my home”, shouted Mrs. Sutherskill (who was very houseproud), shutting the door. “She could have at least offered me a cup of tea”, thought Frank lifting the problem back on his boulders."

Well, it just so happened man that teenage young Henry could not get a golfing job anywhere especially Golfing.\n'It seems I'm a born Brummer like dad Harry says I am,' said Harry quietly for no one was listening to him. So he humbled his way homeward like any other teenage Henry would who couldn't get a golfing job. He spotted the slum of his childhood and said out loud 'Crub' which put it in a nutshell.\n'Mother, Mother, it's me, teenage young Henry, I'm home,' he said hopeing to be noticed. But hag mother just kept on digging as if she had not noticed him and she hadn't. 'Mother, Mother, it's me' he said repeating himself whilst thinking - 'I wonder what she's digging, it can't be the sounds man.' Still the old wretch kept on digging and also singing to herself – a song you don't often hear now a days. 'Mother, Mother,' said peristant teenage Henry, who was beginning to be a bit of a drag.\n'Can't you see I'm burying Soft Harry, your father,' said hag Mother at last.\n'All I wanted was a civil answer,' replied Henry assuming responsibility."

        "lyrics": "(Scene) A broadshouldered room containing hugh fireplace facing a large big windy, a giantsize desk is covered in all type of many business paper and great disorder to look on. There are three or four or five chairs faceing the desk. One are occupied by a scruddy working clog, cap in hook what is gesticulated greatly but humble toward a big fat catipalyst boss. A white man carefully puts coal on the fire and steps back toward a giant door which seems to lead somewhere else. A cat smarting in the corner by the fire leaps up and smiles all on the carpet. A photy of Fieldimarcher Loud Montgammery solving a prodlem looks down on the two men, each of them looking up at it trying to place him.\nA dog is quietly gnawing at a pigmy under the giant desk. The time is half past three on the old grandbladder clock by the windy.\nFatty: 'It's harf parst three Taddpill, and the men haven't done a strike. Why can't we settle this here and now without resorting to a long union discussion and going through all that bit about your father.'\nScruddy: 'Why don't yer shut yer gob yer big fat get or I'll kick yer face in. Yer all the same you rich fat Bourgies, workin' uz poor workers to death and getting all the gelt and going to France for yer 'olidays.'\nFatty: (going all red and ashen) 'But listen Taddpill you're only working two hours a day now, and three days a week and we're losing money as it is, and here you are complaining again about screw screwing and I'm trying to help you. We could have built our factory somewhere else where men like to work, but Ho no here we are governmentsponsored and all that.'\nScruddy: 'Why don't yer shut yer gob yer big fat get or I'll kick yer face in. Yer all the same you rich fat Bourgies, workin' uz poor workers to death and getting all the gelt and going to France for yer 'olidays.'\n(Enter a coloured woman singing a coloured song, On her back is a great bundle.)\nMammy: 'Pope dat barge, left that bail' (She unloads her bundle on the right of the desk.)\nFatty: (Impatiently) 'What is it Mammy, can't you see I'm haveing a prodlem with Taddpill and you come in here all black and sing ing? And get that bundle of ruddish away from my big desk!'\nMammy: 'O.K. Kimu sahib bwana, massa' (she lifts the bundle and eats it) 'Sho' was naice'\nFatty: 'Anyway what was it mammy?'\nMammy: 'Dat was yo' little daughter, by yo secind wife KIMU SAHIB'\nFatty: (colouring) 'But I'm not married, old Mammy' (Mammy clasps her hands to her head horryfried) 'Oh Lord, I've jes' eaten a bastard!'\n(She runs round the room crossing herself, and singing another verse. Scruddy stands up replaceing his cap firmly on his head - walking toward the door he half turns like in the films and shakes his fist.)\n'Get this black woman out of this factory before the men find out, or yer'll 'ave a strike on yer fat Bourgie 'ands. I'm tellin yer that for nothin' yer old bum!'\n(Scruddy walks out of the room leaving Fatty - Mammy and fourteen little Jewish children all singing together a kind of hymn.)\nTHE END"
