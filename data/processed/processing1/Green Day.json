City of the Damned\n\nAt the centre of the earth\nIn the parking lot\nOf the 7-11 where I was taught\nThe motto was just a lie\nIt says: \"Home is Where Your Heart Is\"\nBut what a shame\nCause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same\nIt's beating out of time\n\nCity of the dead\n\nAt the end of another lost highway\nSigns misleading to nowhere\n\nCity of the damned\n\nLost children with dirty faces today\nNo one really seems to care\nI read the graffiti in the bathroom stall\n\nLike the holy scriptures in a shopping mall\n\nAnd so it seemed to confess\n\nIt didn't say much, but it only confirmed\n\nThat the centre of the earth\nIs the end of the world\n\nAnd I could really care less\nCity of the dead\n\nAt the end of another lost highway\nSigns misleading to nowhere\n\nCity of the damned\nTUNNY:\nLost children with dirty faces today\nNo one really seems to care\nIII. I Don't Care\n\nI don't care if you don't-\n\nI don't care if you don't-\n\nI don't care if you don't care\n\nI don't care if you don't-\nI don't care if you don't-\nI don't care if you don't care \nAnd I don't Care!\n\nEveryone's so-\nEveryone's SO-\nEveryone's so-\nEveryone's so-\nEveryone is so full of shit\nBorn and raised by hypocrites\n\nHearts recycled but never saved\nFrom the cradle to the grave\n\nWe are the kids of war and peace\nFrom Anaheim to the Middle East\n\nWe are the stories and disciples of...\n\nThe Jesus of Suburbia!\nLand of make-believe\nAnd it don't believe in me\nLand of make-believe and I don't believe\n\nAnd I don't care!

Dearly Beloved\n\nDearly beloved, are you listening?\nI can't remember a word that you were saying\nAre we demented or am I disturbed?\nThe space that's in between insane and insecure\nOh therapy, can you please fill the void?\nAm I retarded or am I just overjoyed?\nNobody's perfect and I stand accused\nFor lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse\n\nV. Tales of Another Broken Home\n\nTo live and not to breathe\n\nIs to die in tragedy\n\nTo run, to run away\n\nTo find what you believe\nAnd I leave behind\nThis hurricane of fucking lies\n\nI lost my faith to this\n\nThis town that don't exist\n\nSo I run\nI run away\n\nTo find what I believe\nAnd I leave behind\nThis hurricane of fucking lies\nAnd I walked this line\nA million and one fucking times\nBut not this time!\n\nI don't feel any shame\nI won't apologize!\nWhen there ain't nowhere you can go\n\nRunning away from pain\nWhen you've been victimized\nTales from another broken...\n\nHome!\n\nYou're leaving?\nYou're leaving!\nAre you leaving home?1"

East 12th Street\n\nWell nobody cares, well nobody cares\nDoes anyone care if nobody cares?\nWell nobody cares, well nobody cares\nDoes anyone care if nobody cares?\nJesus is filling out paperwork now\nAt the facility on East 12th St\nHe's not listening to a word now\nHe's in his own world and he's daydreaming\nHe'd rather be doing something else now\nLike cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly\nHis life's on the line with anxiety now\nShe had enough and he's had plenty\n\nSomebody get me out of here!\nAnybody get me out of here!\nSomebody get me out of here!\nGet me the fuck right out of here!\n\nSo far away\nI don't want to stay\nGet me outta here right now\nI just wanna be free\nIs there a possibility\nGet me out of here right now\n\nThis lifelike dream ain't for me!\nIII. Nobody Likes You\n\nI fell asleep while watching Spike TV\nAfter ten cups of coffee\nAnd you're still not here\nDreaming of a song\nWhen something went wrong\nBut I can't tell anyone\n'Cause no one's here\nLeft me here alone\nWhen I should have stayed home\nAfter 10 cups of coffee\nI'm thinking...\n\nWhere'd you go?\n\nNobody likes you, everyone left you\n\nWhere'd you go?\n\nThey're all out without you, having fun\n\nWhere'd you go?\n\nEveryone left you, nobody likes you\n\nWhere'd you go?\n\nThey're all out without you, having fun\n\nWhere'd you go?\nGo, go, go?\n\nIV.

We're Coming Home Again\n\nHere they come marching down the street\nLike a desperation murmur of a heart beat\nComing back from the edge of town\nUnderneath their feet\n\nThe time has come and it going nowhere\nNobody ever said that life was fair now\nGo-carts and guns are treasures they will bear\nIn the summer heat\n\nThe world is spinning\nAround and around\nOut of control again\nFrom the 7-11 to the\n\nFear of breaking down!\n\nSo send my love a letterbomb\nAnd visit me in hell\nWe're the ones going...\n\nHome. We're coming home again\nHome. We're coming home again\n\nI started fuckin' running\nAs soon as my feet touched ground\n\nWe're back in the Barrio\nBut to you-\n\n-and me, that's Jingletown, that's...\n\nHome. We're coming home again (x8)\nNobody likes you\nEveryone left you\nThey're all out without you\nHavin' fun!"

Two! Three! Four!\n\nI think there are things that this band can do, that Billie can do as a songwriter, that people still don't know about\n\nFor us, it's just, keep that evolution going\nLet your audience grow with you, and grow up with you\nAnd, and at some point, grow old with you\n\nWhen you see the arc of the three of these records\nYou're gonna fully understand where Green Day was at that point or our creativity\n\nAnd so"
