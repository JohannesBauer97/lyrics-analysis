None of it's real\nYou want to be an MC, you've got to study the skill\n\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up! Step, step up!\nYou might also like\nSo, you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity\nBut mentally, you don't have the hip hop energy\nWith a tendency to make up stories (Bullshit)\nSounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40\nAnd your record company is completely missing it\nAll the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate\nSo in a battle, you can't hack it, react with whack shit\nAnd get smacked with verbal back flips\nGet your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts\nIt's taken decades for MC's to establish this\nYou're new to hip-hop, and welcome if your serious\nBut not on the mic, leave that to the experienced\n\nUsing the waves of sound\nThe true master paralyzes his opponents\nLeaving him vulnerable to attack\n\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up! Step, step up!\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up! Step, step up! Step up!\n\nAfter years of pain-staking research by the world's leading sound scientists\nWe here at the sound institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system\nActual movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the cellular structure of the human body\nAnd the question must be asked…\n\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up! Step, step up!\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up! Step, step up!\n\nMix Media\nStep Up the microphone\nAnd you do it like this\nAnd you do it like\nStep Up the microphone\nMix Media\nAnd you do it like this\nMix Media\nStep Up the microphone\nAnd you do it like this\nMix Media\nStep Up the microphone\nAnd you do it like this"

She can only fool hersеlf\n\nI never know just why you run\nSo far away, far away from me\nI never know just why you run\nSo far away, far away from me\n\nWhen it comes to how to live his life, he can't be told\nSays he's got it all under control\nThinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with\nBut in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit\nAn addict and he can't hold the reigns\nThe pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same\nTries to slow down the problem he's got\nBut can't get off the carousel until he makes it stop\nYou might also like\nHe can only fool himself for so long\nHe can only fool himself for so long\nHe can only fool himself for so long\n(I'm too weak to face me!) He can only fool himself\n\nI never know just why you run\nSo far away, far away from me\nI never know just why you run\nSo far away, far away from me\n\nFly with me, under the wings I gave you\nTry to be closer to me and I'll save you\nFly with me, under the wings I gave you\nTry to be closer to me and I'll save you\n\nI never know just why you run\nSo far away, far away from me\nI never know just why you run\nSo far away, far away from me\nI never know just why you run\nSo far away, far away from me\nI never know just why you run\nSo far away, far away from me"

Stay!\"\nCobra Kai flystyles, I'm kicking\nSticking emcees real quick 'cause times ticking\nAt the drop of a tenpence, I let loose the venom\nSending a shot of verbal heat up in them\nThe ending is done, grab your family and run\nApocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots at the sun\nYou might also likeRecord industry rule four thousand eighty-one:\nQuestion my intentions and your whole world is done\nLike Forrest, you'll run, turn your eyeballs into Saturn\nFull Metal Jacket, fully auto-rhyme pattern\n\nNow I see what I have, I want you\nBe with me, or stick and move\nNow I see what I had, I want you\nBe with me, or stick and move\n\nSticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked\nMoving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving\nSticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked\nMoving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving\nSticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked\nMoving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving\nSticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked\nMoving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving\n\nNow I see what I have, I want you\nBe with me, or stick and move\nNow I see what I had, I want you\nBe with me, or stick and move"

None of it's real\nYou wanna be an MC? You've gotta study the skill\n\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up! Step, step up!\nYou might also like\nSo, you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity\nBut mentally, you don't have the hip-hop energy\nWith a tendency to make up stories (Bullshit)\nSounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40 (Top 40)\nAnd your record company is completely missin' it\nAll the kids are dissin' it for not bein' legitimate\nSo in a battle, you can't hack it, react with wack shit\nAnd get smacked with verbal backflips\nGet your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts\nIt's taken decades for MC's to establish this\nYou're new to hip-hop, and welcome if you're serious\nBut not on the mic, leave that to the experienced\n\nUsing the waves of sound\nThe true master paralyzes his opponents\nLeaving him vulnerable to attack\n\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up! Step, step up!\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up! Step, step up! Step up!\nAfter years of pain-staking research by the world's leading sound scientists\nWe here at the Sound Institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system\nActual movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the cellular structure of the human body\nAnd the question must be asked…\n\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nBring it to you every time like this?\nWho can rock a rhyme like this?\nStep, step up!
