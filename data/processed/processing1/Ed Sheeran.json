I'll take it back now\n\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\nYou might also like\nI take it back with the rhythm and blues\nWith my rap pack, I'll be singing the news\nTryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school\nI'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop\nBringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes\nI'll give you the truth through the vocal booth\nAnd stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit\nThey try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot\nBut then again that's what they're supposed to do\nAnd I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm\nWhispering, \"Everything that happens is from now on\"\nI'll be ready to start again by the end of the song\nAnd still they're claiming that I handle it wrong\nBut then I've never had an enemy except the NME\nBut I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be\nWith only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees\nAre healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree\nSinging for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids\nI keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic\nI'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it\nThis song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now\n\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo, I'll take it back now\nNow, I don't ever wanna be perfect\n'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless\nAnd I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed\nTaking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus\nPutting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton\nConsidering a name change, thinking it was hopeless\nRhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition\n'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written\nNow absence can make your heart ache\nBut drinking Absinthe can change your mind state\nVividly, need to let my liver be\nAnd I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends\nIt's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\n'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally\nIt might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but\nBut I just write schemes\nI'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely\nYou'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates\nHaving a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made\nAnd every single second knowing that we'll never betray\nThe way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down\nThat's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\n\nMy dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme\nTill I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?\nWith this you must know that the numbers just sold\nWill keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\nWe forget 90 percent of it when we wake\nBut the other 10 percent, it never fades\nDreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads\nTried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade\nOh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more\nA couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought\nYou'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors\nNow I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour\nWriting love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit\nYou can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\nI'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss\nAnd most of these other guys are kids that pose\nHis little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is\nDreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it\nTread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower\nYou'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow\nIgh!58"

I wanna know\"\nNo prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness\nYou open the front door, he boots you in\nThere's something new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror\nGet your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error\nHe towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight\nAt this point, your life flashes before your eyes\nYour handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor\nDespite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye\nAnd in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece\nAnd dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street\nLittle lady left this earth in the worst way\nAll because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday\nAnd we're all under the upper hand\nAnd going mad for a couple grams\nAnd we don't wanna go outside, tonight\n'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland\nAnd sell love to another man\nIt's too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nFor angels to fly\nAnd fly, fly\nFor angels to fly\nTo fly, to fly\nAnd angels to die17"

to ride\nThe paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\nFriends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride\nAnd when the world's against me is when I really come alive\nAnd every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\nYou know that I've got whisky with white lines, and smoke in my lungs\nI think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun\nI need to get in the right mind and clear myself up\nInstead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become\nI guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me\nWithout a nine-to-five job or a uni degree\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\nThey showed me the locked doors I find another use of key\nAnd you'll see\n\nI'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nI used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs\nI chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\nI think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell\nRelationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well\nAnd ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\nBecause you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun\nPlease know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run\nI beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become\nOur conversations with my father on the A14\nAge twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams\nNow I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me\nWith my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans\nWembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou\nI may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud\nAnd to the next generation, inspiration's allowed\nThe world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now\nSomehow\n\nI'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nYou might also like\nI woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror\nThinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner\nThe industry told me to look like them\nBut I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner\nI wish that she could have been my first time\nAnd I wish that I'd never took that first line\nAnd I wish that every word in this verse rhymed\nBut forgive me if it doesn't\nI wish that I could make peace with my older cousin\nI wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't\nI wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'\nAnd the taste stays underneath my tongue, and\nWish that I had known what to do as a youngen\nWish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party\nWith that hardly matters now, man, does it?\nWish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it\nI wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget\nBut while we're on the subject\nI wish my private life would have never gone public\nBut that's the sacrifice that we make\nSpendin' my whole time high livin' life away\n\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI wish my family and friends, they stay healthy\nI wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy\nI found myself late night wishin' on a star\nEveryday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh\nAnd I wish I'd never run through\nEvery woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to\nI wish I was the role model you looked up to\nIf I told my fans the things I did they'd say, \"Fuck you\"\nI wish I was home more\nI wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour\nAnd I wish I'd grown more, wish I told more\nPeople that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for\nAnd I wish he never got cancer\nAnd if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?\nOh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressing 'cause\nEvery day this cocaine gets the best of us\nUsin' my balance on razor blades\nSpendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait\n\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\n\nI'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat coat\nMum sayin', \"Don't smoke,\" no, I don't listen, I got\nLove for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast\nPeople that I don't know share the same vision\nI find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine\nTryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign\nSometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme\nStarin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine\nShit quick before I hit it again\nSurrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men\nAnd who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen\nJust let me hit the studio when we can rip it again\nI'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick\nMy daddy told me, \"Work hard and you can never be shit\"\nI've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad\nSet back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had\nOne wish9"

would wait\nBut then I jump right in\nA week later returned, I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn\nBut I gave her my time for two or three nights\nThen I put it on pause 'til the moment was right\nI went away for months until our paths crossed again\nShe told me I was never looking for a friend\nMaybe you could swing by my room around 10\nBaby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin\nWe'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM\nBaby if you wanted me then you should've just said\nShe's singing\nAh lah\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my home\nI don't wanna know that babe\nAh lah\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that babe\nAh lahmlahlah\nYou might also likeFor a couple weeks I\nOnly want to see her\nWe drink away the days with a take-away pizza\nBefore a text message was the only way to reach her\nNow she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her\nSinging out Aretha\nAll over the track like a feature\nAnd never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either\nBut me and her we make money the same way\nFour cities, two planes the same day ah\nThose shows have never been what it's about\nBut maybe we'll go together and just figure it out\nI'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch\nBut we should get on a plane\nOr we'll be missing it now\nI wish I'd have written it down\nThe way that things played out\nWhen she was kissing him how\nI was confused about\nShe should figure it out while I'm sat here singing\nAh lah\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my home\nI don't wanna know that babe\nAh lah\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that babe\nAh lahmlahlah\n(knock, knock, knock)\nOn my hotel door\nI don't even know if she knows what for\nShe was crying on my shoulder\nI already told ya\nTrust and respect is what we do this for\nI never intended to be next\nBut you didn't need to take him to bed that's all\nAnd I never saw him as a threat\nUntil you disappeared with him to have sex of course\nIt's not like we were both on tour\nWe were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\nAnd I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment\nBut it was never just fun and I thought you were different\nThis is not the way you realise what you wanted\nIt's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest\nAll this time God knows I'm singing\nAh lah\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my home\nI don't wanna know that babe\nAh lah\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that babe\nAh lah\nDon't fuck with my love\nThese girls ain't loyal\nThat heart is so cold\nThis girl ain't loyal\nAh lah\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that babe\nAh lahmlahlah\nShorty get down, good Lord\nBaby got 'em open all over town\nStrictly biz she don't play around\nCover much grounds\nGot game by the pound\nGetting paid is her forte\nEach and every day true player way\nI can't get her outta my mind (say what)\nI think about the girl all the time\nEast side to the west side\nPush your fat rides it's no surprise\nShe got tricks in the stash\nStacking up the cash\nQuick when it comes to the gas\nBy no means average\nShe's on when she's got to have it\nBaby you're a perfect 10\nI wanna get in\nLemmi get down so I can win, sing it\nI like the way you work it (no diggity)\nI got to bag it up\nI like the way you work it (no diggity)\nI got to bag it up (bag it up

chances while we dancin in the party fo' sho'\nSlip my hoe a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'\nBitches lookin at me strange but you know I don't care\nStep up in this motherfucker just a-swangin my hair\nBitch quit talkin, quick walk if you down with the set\nTake a bullet and take it down with this jet\nOut of town, put it down for the Father of Rap\nAnd if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut

doooooog)\nNa-na-na-na-na\nYou know I'm mobbin with the D.R.E\nHeyo heyo heyo heyoooooo\nDamn that girls looks good\nHeyo heyo heyo heyoooooo\nPlay on, play on, play on\nHeyo heyo heyo heyoooooo\nDamn that girl looks good\nHeyo heyo heyo heyoooooo\nI met you when I was a teen\nBut then you were one as well\nAnd I could play a guitar\nJust like ringing a bell\nSometimes I wonder\nIn any other summer could you have been my part time lover\nTo me listening to Stevie Wonder\nUnder the covers where we used to lay\nAnd re: stacks is what the speakers played\nI'd be on tour almost every day\nWhen I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay\nJust watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed\nGetting high as two kites when we needed to breathe\nWe used each other's air just for the people to see\nAnd stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep\nWe'd go anywhere, our minds would take us\nAnd I said you are beautiful without your make-up\nAnd you don't even need to worry about your weight cause\nWe can all be loved the way that God made us\nAnd time's the only reason that we could break up\nCause you would always tell me I'm away too much\nDistance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane\nOr make a mistake, say it again\nOh Nina\nYou should go Nina\n'Cause I ain't never coming home\nNina oh, won't you leave me now\nAnd I've been living on the road Nina\nBut then again you should know Nina\nCause that's you and me both\nNina oh, won't you leave me now\nNow\nAnd every weekend in the winter\nYou'd be wearing my hoodie\nWith draw strings pulled tight\nTo keep your face from the cold\nTaking day trips to the local\nWhere we'd eat on our own\nCause every day when I was away\nWe'd only speak on the phone\nWatching Blue Planet\nCreating new habits\nThen as if we were two rabbits\nAnd then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the Celtics\nI disappear\nYou call me selfish, I understand\nBut I can't help it\nI put my job over everything\nExcept my family and friends\nBut you'll be in between forever\nSo I guess we'll have to take a step back\nOverlook the situation\nCause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications\nAnd I'm not saying we should be taking a break\nJust re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late\nSo we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane\nBut in a day we'll have to say it again\nOh Nina\nYou should go Nina\n'Cause I ain't never coming home\nNina oh, won't you leave me now\nAnd I've been living on the road Nina\nBut then again you should know Nina\nCause that's you and me both Nina\nUh won't you leave me now\nNow\nLove will come and love will go\nBut you can make it on your own\nSing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now\nPeople grow, and fall apart\nBut you can mend your broken heart\nTake it back, go, oh won't you leave me now\nOh Nina\nYou should go Nina\n'Cause I ain't never coming home\nNina oh, won't you leave me now\nAnd I've been living on the road Nina\nAnd then again you should know Nina\nCause that's you and me\nBoth in a road, won't you leave me now\nNow"

up and listen\nStudio is a system\nAnd you could say that I'm driven\nAnd now it's onto the next saga\nWe drink the best lager\nI'll never try to win you over like your stepfather\nI do my own thing now\nAnd get respect after\nAnd I'm avoiding the 'caine\nLike it was Get Carter\nFor four years I never had a place to stay\nBut it's safe to say that it kept me grounded\nLike a paper weight\nAt 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home\nI was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked\nWent from sleeping at a subway station\nTo sleeping with a movie star\nAnd adding to the population\nNot my imagination\nI don't wanna relax\nWould it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?\nI take it back now\nYou might also likeMmmm come on and take it back love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back love\nNo\nI take it back with the rhythm and blues\nWith my rap pack I'll be singing the news\nTryin' act like Jack Black\nWhen I bring it to school\nI make a beat with my feet\nBy just hittin' the loop\nBringing the lyrics to prove\nThat I can fit in these shoes\nI give you the truth through the vocal booth\nAnd stars burst out on the scene\nLike an opal fruit\nThey try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot\nBut then again that's what they're supposed to do\nAnd I'm supposed to be calm\nI tattooed the lyrics onto my arm\nWhispering everything that happens\nIs from now on\nI'll be ready to start again\nBy the end of the song\nSince they are claiming I handled it wrong\nBut then I've never had an enemy\nExcept the NME but I'll be selling\nTwice as many copies as their magazine will ever be\nWith only spectacles ahead of me\nAnd festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree\nSinging for the masses rubber dingied rapids\nI keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic\nI'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it\nThis song's from the heart cover the planet\nI take it back now\nMmmm come on and take it back love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back love\nNo\nAnd take it back now\nNow I don't ever wanna be perfect\nCause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless\nAnd I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed\nTaken my first steps into the scene giving me focus\nPutting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton\nConsidering a name change thinking it was hopeless\nRhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition\n'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written\nNow absence can make your heart ache\nBut drinking absinth can change your mind state\nVividly need to let my liver be\nAnd I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends\nIs good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\n'Cause that how it's supposed to be\nI'm screaming out vocally\nIt might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams\nBut, but I just write schemes\nI'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be\nBut more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates\nHaving a pint of McDaid discussing records we made\nAnd every single second knowing that we'll never betray\nThe way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out\nIt's time to take it back now\nMmmm come on and take it back love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back love\nNo\nMmm come on and take it back love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back love\nNo\nVery superstitious, writings on the wall\nVery superstitious, ladders bout' to fall\nThirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass\nSeven years of bad luck, the good things in your past\nBelieving things that you don't understand\nThen you suffer\nSuperstition ain't the way\nSuperstition ain't the way\nSuperstition ain't the way\nSuperstition ain't the way\nSuperstition ain't the way\nMy dreams keep me awake at night\nWritten in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype\nAm I just living the lie\nWith this you must know that the number's just sold whoa\nWill keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\nWe forget 90 per cent of it when we wake\nBut the other 10 per cent it never fades\nDreaming dreams, day to day goals\nStay awake loads, try to make the cut like the\nPaper or razor blade, oh, never give up\nAnd just remember just to hold out more\nA couple years ago\nI couldn't just control that thought\nYou'd find me buskin' on the street\nWhen it was cold outdoors\nAnd now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour\nWriting love songs for the sake of it\nNever to make a hit\nYou can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\nI'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and\nMost of these other guys are kids that Pulses\nLittle sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is\nDreams you own, just set your goals\nAnd have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path\nYou'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know\nWhere you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha\nSuperstition ain't the way\nSuperstition ain't the way\nSuperstition ain't the way\nSuperstition ain't the way\nSuperstition ain't the way\nSuperstition, babe\nSuperstition, babe\nSuperstition, babe\nSuperstition, babe\nSuperstition, babe\nSuperstition, babe\nSuperstition, babe\nSuperstition, babe\nCause ain't no sunshine when she's gone\nIt's not warm when she's away\nCause ain't no sunshine when she's gone\nShe's always gone too long\nAnytime she goes away\nI wonder this time where she's gone\nWonder if she's gone to stay\nCause ain't no sunshine when she's gone\nShe's always gone too long\nAnytime she goes away\nAnd I know,

anytime she goes away\nSuperstition ain't the way\nOh anytime she goes away\nSuperstition ain't the way\nOh anytime she goes away\nSuperstition ain't the way"
