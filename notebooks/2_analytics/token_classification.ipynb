    "# Token Classification\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of classifying tokens according to a class, for example, identifying a token as a person, an organisation or a location. Token classification models usually leverage pre-trained word embeddings and a bi-directional RNN (LSTM or GRU) to produce a tag for each token in the input sequence. The figure below shows the general architecture of a token classification model.\n",
